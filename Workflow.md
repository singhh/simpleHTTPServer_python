# Setup Simple HTTP Server using Python


I learned how to spin up a HTTPServer in python to work in my dev environment  so I can test my work etc. Here I am going to show you and share how it can be achived in few simple steps.


Assumptions:

You are using Linux or MacOS system

Steps:


First, check version of Pyhton on your system by executing following in terminal

	$ python -V

Secondly, change directory to your project 

Thirdly, run the following command

	$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Lastly, open up your internet browser and in url bar type:
	
	http://localhost:8000

Here you have local http server running using python version that is already installed and now you are ready to open any project file that you may have to test.

It is fairly easy to install new or upgraded version of Python just follow the steps listed at https://www.python.org/, click on 'download' and download the appropriate version for your platform.
